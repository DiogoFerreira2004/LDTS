# St. Tryna's Tower
## Description
In this project, we made a game within the dungeon-crawler and roguelite genre. The game starts on floor 25 and the player ventures deeper and deeper into the tower. On floor 1, the player can finally leave the dungeon. Each floor has several rooms, and the goal is to traverse them and reach the stairs on the opposite side of the floor.
